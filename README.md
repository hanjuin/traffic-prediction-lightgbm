# Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the LightGBM machine learning model to perform traffic volume prediction based on real-world traffic data.

# Dataset
Source: NZTA Open Data Portal â€“ Traffic Counts Dataset

Make sure to download and extract the dataset before running the code.

# How to Run
Download the source code and the dataset.

Place both files in the same folder.

Extract the dataset ZIP file in the folder.

Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) in any Python-compatible IDE (such as Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, etc.).

Run the cells step-by-step to train and evaluate the LightGBM traffic prediction model, or look at the cell output for results.

# Requirements
Ensure your Python environment includes the following packages:

lightgbm
